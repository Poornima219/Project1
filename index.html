        <h1 class="text1">About Missile man of India</h1>
    </div>
    <!-- <p class="text">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  15 October 1931 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. </p>
    <p class="text">He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.</p>
    
    <p class="text">He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.</p> --> 
    <!-- <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress</p> -->
    <p class="para2">After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology with a degree in aeronautical engineering, Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958. He joined the Indian Space Research Organisation in 1969 as project director of the SLV-III, the country’s first satellite launch vehicle. When he returned to the DRDO in 1982, he oversaw a programme that resulted in a number of successful missiles, earning him the moniker Missile Man.

        From 1992 to 1997, Kalam was the defence ministers scientific adviser, and from 1999 to 2001, he was the government’s principal scientific adviser with the title of cabinet minister. Although the tests raised worldwide alarm, Kalam’s important role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons testing cemented India’s status as a nuclear power and elevated him as a national hero. In 1998, Kalam proposed Technology Vision 2020, a statewide strategy that he described as a road map for converting India from a developing to a developed society in 20 years. Increasing agricultural productivity, prioritising technology as an engine for economic growth, and expanding access to health care and education were among the goals outlined in the plan.</p>
